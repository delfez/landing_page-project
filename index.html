     <p><em>Of the 185 nations of the world, only five have the power to monopolize nuclear armament, and impose on others
        the humiliation of signing non proliferation of nuclear weapons treaties. It is necessary to build the bomb, not to throw
        it at anyone, but to avoid having a bomb thrown here! On Brasil, our home, and don't say it cannot happen, because
        the United States did it with Japan in 1945. If Japan had the bomb, no one would dare to destroy their two cities,
        Hiroshima and Nagazaki.</em></p>
